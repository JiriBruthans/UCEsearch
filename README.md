Cell search engine based on UCE embeddings and pinecone vector database.

Works nice:
Searching for index 1 (astrocyte), returns: 
['1', '2', '4', '3', '1173']
astrocyte
astrocyte
astrocyte
astrocyte
differentiation-committed oligodendrocyte precursor

and astocyte is quite close to oligodendrocyte in cell ontology:
